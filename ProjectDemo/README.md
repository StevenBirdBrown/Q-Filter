# Introduction To Our Demonstration Website
This is an interactive demonstration to showcase our project on detection of unfriendly questions in online forums. 

We will be including our model and our demonstration website HTML code in this repository since we will not run our instance any more.

## Static and Template
We adopt a [template](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog) to display our result and the file app.py is the main file to run it.

## Models
We have bert.py and textcnn.py that include our model modified from our textbook.

## Parameters and Data
We include the parameters of our model in the param files which also include our cleaned datasets.
