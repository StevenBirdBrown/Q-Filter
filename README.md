# Introduction To Our Demonstration Website
This is an interactive demonstration to showcase our project on detection of unfriendly questions in online forums. 

We will be including our model and our demonstration website HTML code in this repository since we will not run our instance any more.

## Project
We have BERT and TextCNN files that include our model modified from our textbook. We include the parameters and data set as well.

## ProjectDemo
We adopt a [template](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/code_snippets/tree/master/Python/Flask_Blog) to display our result and the file app.py is the main file to run it.

## Project Report
To access our report files in LaTeX and PDF forms.
